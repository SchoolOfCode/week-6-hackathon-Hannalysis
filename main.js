// Ah, so you're fresh meat for our ranks! We'll be kind to you as it's your first day on the field.
// Go create yourself a damage modifier maggot! I hope you can read, as the damageBuff requirements are listed below:
/* 
- Whatever your base damage, the damageBuff mod will buff you by 50% 
- This is not rounded up or down
- If for some reason your base damage is non-existant (or heavens-forbid, minus figures) the mod will reassign that base value to the minimum accepted value (1).
- In the unfortunate rare event that a number posing as a string is passed through your mod, it will treat it as a numeral value

// Terrorist and Counter Terrorist separate arrays of available weaponry
//The challenge would be to input a weapon name and the function would return what team can equip it
